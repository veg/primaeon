/**
 * review-regressions.test.js — ported from datamonkey3/src/test/axomeme-review-regressions.test.js
 * (main@fac1330). Both cases exercise the LIBRARY (prepareAlignment, batchSizeFor) through the
 * package name the app consumes, so they double as a check that the file: link resolves and that
 * the two invariants the pipeline relies on — selectedIndices, and batches too large to spread —
 * still hold in the library the app is built against.
