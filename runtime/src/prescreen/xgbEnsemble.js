/**
 * xgbEnsemble.js — part of the MEME hit-likelihood prescreen.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Ported verbatim from datamonkey3/src/lib/services/prescreen/xgbEnsemble.js
 * (main@fac1330), together with meme_gate.json (XGBoost's own save_model output), its sidecar
 * meme_gate.meta.json, and the two fixture files, as one directory (PLAN.md §6 reuse map). It is
 * the "MEME hit-likelihood prescreen" row of the "Before you run" panel (PLAN.md §4.3): an
 * ADVISORY band, never a gate. The original header follows.
 *
 * xgbEnsemble.js — the entire browser-side runtime for the MEME hit-likelihood gate.
 *
 * It reads XGBoost's OWN `Booster.save_model()` output (meme_gate.json) and walks it. There is no
 * converter in this pipeline any more: the bytes the ML team exports are the bytes this file
 * parses. The previous shape — sklearn -> an interchange graph -> a converter script -> a
 * coefficient table -> a JS walker — had four hops where the contract could drift, and it drifted
 * twice in three days (the exported classifier node silently became a regressor plus a sigmoid; the
 * monotone HistGBM would not export at all, so the shipped model was a different model family from
 * the validated one). That whole limb is deleted, which is why a repo-wide grep for the old
 * interchange format now comes back empty — see scripts/prescreen/verify_parity.py --self-test.
 *
 * The cost of removing the converter is that this file now has to do the converter's other job:
 * REFUSING a model it does not understand. A converter fails at build time when it meets an
 * unsupported construct. A walker that just walks will happily produce a confident, wrong number.
 * So `prepareXgbModel` validates before it compiles, and every check below throws rather than
 * degrades. See "WHAT THIS REFUSES" for the list and the reason each one is not paranoia.
 *
 * Verified against xgboost 3.4.0's own `Booster.inplace_predict` on the shipped meme_gate.json.
 * EVERY NUMBER BELOW IS PRINTED BY A COMMAND IN THIS REPO — none of them is a remembered figure
 * from a run nobody can reproduce, which is the failure mode a file like this one is most prone to:
 *
 *   scripts/prescreen/verify_parity.py
 *     5,532 vectors — a 2,520-point grid, 3,000 real production feature rows and 12 adversarial /
 *     on-threshold rows — agree to max |Δ| = 4.409e-07 with ZERO band disagreements. (The corpus
 *     third needs MEME_VALIDATION_TSV; without it the run is 2,532 vectors and says so.)
 *   scripts/prescreen/verify_parity.py --boundary
 *     4,799 rows with at least one feature sitting EXACTLY on one of this model's own split
 *     thresholds: max |Δ| = 4.106e-07, zero band disagreements. See the note on `<` in evalXgbModel.
 *
 * The residual is float32 (XGBoost accumulates leaf values in float32) vs float64 (we accumulate
 * in float64). It cannot move a user-visible band: verify_parity.py asserts the band agreement
 * rather than the delta, and reports how close any score comes to a cut (4.474e-04, three orders
 * above the delta) so that margin is a measurement rather than an assumption.

 * apply the link at load. This walker takes it as a probability and computes `log(p / (1 - p))`
 * itself (see prepareXgbModel), so on a 1.x export it would logit an already-logitted number.
 *
 * That is the worst shape a bug can have here: it scores WITHOUT ERROR and WRONGLY, on the one
 * field that shifts every score in the model. It is also only half-caught by parseBaseScore's
 * (0, 1) range check — a 1.x binary:logistic default saves margin 0, which is refused, but any
 * margin that happens to land inside (0, 1) is accepted and silently rescales the whole model.
 * Measured: a doc labelled [1, 7, 6] with base_score "0.3" scores [50, 200, 0.02] at 0.6135
 * ('uncertain') where the shipped model gives 0.9551 ('likely') — a band move on a live input.
 *
 * scripts/prescreen/verify_parity.py's contract check has always refused version < 2 for exactly
 * this reason. The browser is the only place that actually loads a model, so it must not be the
 * weaker of the two. Widening this range means re-running that gate against the new export first.

 * out reformatted — `-3.8970377E-2` becomes `-0.038970377` — and the chunk is 52,008 bytes smaller
 * than the file. That transform is value-preserving (verified: 0 bit-differences across all 96,964

 * 735,876-byte file verbatim inside a 33-byte wrapper (`const E='…';export{E as default};` —
 * esbuild quotes with `'`, so the JSON's own `"` need no escaping). That means the sha256 the
 * parity gate pins is a hash of the bytes the browser actually parses, not of a sibling of them.
 *

/**
 * WHAT THIS REFUSES, and why each refusal is load-bearing rather than defensive decoration.
 *
 * Every item below is a construct that this walker would score WITHOUT ERROR and WRONGLY. That is
 * the whole hazard class: a researcher reading "unlikely to find sites" has no way to tell a
 * correct 0.19 from a 0.19 produced by summing the wrong output group.
 *
 *  - booster != gbtree           `dart` scales each tree by a dropout weight that lives outside
 *                                the tree arrays; summing raw leaves gives a systematically
 *                                inflated margin. `gblinear` has no `trees` key at all.
 *  - objective != binary:logistic  The link is objective-specific. `reg:squarederror` needs NO
 *                                sigmoid, `count:poisson` needs exp, `rank:pairwise` has no
 *                                probability meaning at all — and all three would come out of a
 *                                sigmoid as a number in [0,1] that looks exactly like a
 *                                probability. `binary:logitraw` is the same tree table with the
 *                                sigmoid already the caller's job.
 *  - num_class not 0/1           multi:softprob interleaves K trees per boosting round; a naive
 *                                walk sums all K groups into one margin. The result is a
 *                                plausible-looking number with no meaning.
 *  - tree_info not all 0         The same failure detected structurally rather than from a
 *                                declared field. Both are checked: a hand-edited or
 *                                partially-written file can have one without the other.
 *  - num_parallel_tree != 1      Random-forest mode: trees within a round are AVERAGED, not
 *                                summed. Summing n_estimators * num_parallel_tree leaves
 *                                overshoots by exactly the factor nobody would notice.
 *  - size_leaf_vector != 1       Vector-leaf (multi-output) trees pack k values per leaf; the leaf
 *                                value is then no longer `split_conditions[i]` and every leaf read
 *                                is off by a stride.
 *  - any categorical split       A categorical node stores a BITSET in `categories` and
 *                                `split_conditions[i]` is an index into `categories_segments`, not
 *                                a threshold. Comparing a feature value against that index is
 *                                nonsense that still routes somewhere. Checked twice — `split_type`
 *                                per node AND the `categories_nodes` array — because a file can
 *                                carry one and not the other.
 *  - feature arity mismatch      Silent in BOTH directions. A 4-wide row into a 3-feature model
 *                                scores identically to a 3-wide one (the extra slot is never
 *                                indexed). A 3-wide row into a 4-feature model routes every split
 *                                on the missing feature by `undefined < threshold`, which is
 *                                false, i.e. consistently down the right child. Neither errors.
 *  - feature_names disagree      If the exporter recorded names, a reordered training frame is
 *                                caught for free. Reordered features produce a fully valid model
 *                                that scores confident nonsense. (This model ships with the array
 *                                empty, so this check is dormant here — it is written now so a
 *                                future export that DOES carry names is checked, rather than
 *                                needing someone to notice and add it.)
 *  - malformed tree topology     Cycles hang the browser; a child index past the end reads
 *                                `undefined` and compares false forever. Both are cheap to prove
 *                                absent once, at load, and impossible to check for free in the
 *                                hot loop.
 *  - format major outside 2..3   BELOW: a 1.x export writes base_score as a MARGIN, so the logit
 *                                below is applied to an already-logitted number and every score in
 *                                the model shifts — silently, and past the (0, 1) guard whenever
 *                                the margin happens to land inside (0, 1). ABOVE: a future XGBoost
 *                                that changes the gbtree layout should stop this walker rather than
 *                                be walked with the old assumptions. See SUPPORTED_FORMAT_MAJORS.

/**
 * P(MEME reports at least one site at p <= 0.1) for one feature row.
 *
 * MISSING VALUES ARE REFUSED, NOT ROUTED — a deliberate choice, not an omission.
 *
 * XGBoost encodes `default_left` per interior node and routes NaN there. We do not implement it:
 *   1. There is no "missing" in this domain. The three features are geometry read off an
 *      alignment and a tree that both parsed. When they cannot be computed, the caller's domain
 *      guard returns status 'cannot-assess' — an explanation — rather than a row with a hole in it.
 *      A NaN arriving here therefore means feature extraction is broken, and the only correct
 *      response to that is an exception, not a probability.
 *   2. Implementing it would put a per-node NaN test on a hot loop that executes ~4,500 times per
 *      score, to support a path no test can legitimately reach and that would therefore rot. In
 *      THIS model every default_left is 0, i.e. missing routes RIGHT — the opposite of what the
 *      field's name suggests to a reader. Writing that branch, getting it backwards, and never
 *      exercising it is a very ordinary way to ship a silent bug.
 *   3. The refusal is the forcing function. If missingness ever becomes real (say a future model
 *      is trained with "no tree supplied" as a signal), this throw fires on day one and the
 *      default_left semantics get implemented and tested on purpose. `meta.defaultLeftNodes`
 *      exists so that change is visible in the parity report before anyone hits the throw.
 *
 * @param {PreparedModel} model
 * @param {number[]|Float64Array} features - [num_seqs, num_sites, median_pos_dist]
