/**
 * hitLikelihood.js — part of the MEME hit-likelihood prescreen.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Ported verbatim from datamonkey3/src/lib/services/prescreen/hitLikelihood.js
 * (main@fac1330), together with meme_gate.json (XGBoost's own save_model output), its sidecar
 * meme_gate.meta.json, and the two fixture files, as one directory (PLAN.md §6 reuse map). It is
 * the "MEME hit-likelihood prescreen" row of the "Before you run" panel (PLAN.md §4.3): an
 * ADVISORY band, never a gate. The original header follows.
 *
 * hitLikelihood.js — DM3-side wrapper around the MEME hit-likelihood estimate.
 *
 * The estimator is client-side and geometry-only: given a codon alignment + a branch-length tree
 * it estimates P(a full MEME run reports at least one selected site) and buckets it into
 * likely / uncertain / unlikely. It is ADVISORY ONLY — it never blocks a run, and the vocabulary
 * is chosen so nothing in it can be read as a promise to.
 *
 * This module keeps the Svelte component thin and the logic unit-testable:
 *   - loadHitLikelihoodModel(): load the scorer once (pure JS; nothing native, nothing fetched).
 *   - estimateHitLikelihood(): the pure decision — ALWAYS returns a result object with a status.
 *
 * Scope: MEME only. The training label is "MEME found selection", so it is not calibrated for any
 * other method; callers pass the method and we return status 'not-applicable' for non-MEME. Ask
 * scope.js (which imports nothing) BEFORE loading this module if all you need is the scope check.
 *
 * FOUR STATUSES, never null. Blank space used to mean three different things:
 *   'ok'             a real estimate — level / hit_probability / recommendation are populated
 *   'not-applicable' this method isn't MEME, or there is no alignment yet — render nothing
 *   'cannot-assess'  we have input but it is outside the range the model can speak to — render
 *                    the reason, never a number (see checkFeatureDomain)
 *   'error'          the estimator itself failed — `detail` says so; this module does not throw

 * converter, no intermediate format, no WASM: the bytes the ML team exports are the bytes parsed
 * here. Verified against xgboost's own scoring of the same file at max |Δ| 4.4e-07 with ZERO band
 * disagreements over 5,532 vectors, 3,000 of them real production jobs.
 *
 * Be honest about the trade this made: the payload went from ~4 KB gzipped to ~169 KB gzipped, 40x
 * more, for a better-calibrated and structurally-monotone model. It is still three orders of
 * magnitude below the 13.5 MB an ML runtime would have cost, it is still fetched from our own
 * origin with a content hash and nothing else, and — the part that actually matters — it is
 * exactly ZERO bytes for every method that is not MEME, because the import lives behind
 * hasHitLikelihood() and a dynamic import().
 *
 * "ZERO" is meant literally, and it took a fix to become true. A dynamic import() keeps the JS
 * lazy but NOT the CSS: SvelteKit lists a dynamically-imported component's stylesheet in the
 * route's own stylesheet array so the component cannot flash unstyled, which made
 * MemeHitLikelihood's <style> block a render-blocking <link> on every page load, for every method,
 * in the production build only. The row's CSS now travels as a string inside the lazy chunk (see
 * MemeHitLikelihood.css). e2e/18 asserts the whole invariant by classifying response BODIES rather
 * than URLs, so it means the same thing against a production build as against the dev server.
 *
