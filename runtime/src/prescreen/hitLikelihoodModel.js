/**
 * hitLikelihoodModel.js — part of the MEME hit-likelihood prescreen.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Ported verbatim from datamonkey3/src/lib/services/prescreen/hitLikelihoodModel.js
 * (main@fac1330), together with meme_gate.json (XGBoost's own save_model output), its sidecar
 * meme_gate.meta.json, and the two fixture files, as one directory (PLAN.md §6 reuse map). It is
 * the "MEME hit-likelihood prescreen" row of the "Before you run" panel (PLAN.md §4.3): an
 * ADVISORY band, never a gate. The original header follows.
 *
 * hitLikelihoodModel.js — client-side MEME HIT-LIKELIHOOD estimate for DataMonkey (DM3).
 *
 * Label-free, geometry-only: given a codon alignment (FASTA or NEXUS) and a newick tree, it
 * estimates P(a full HyPhy MEME run reports at least one selected site). No server, no HyPhy.
 *
 * READ THIS BEFORE TRUSTING THE NUMBER. The training label is the event the UI actually names:
 * "MEME reported at least one site at p <= 0.1". So it predicts what MEME will REPORT on this
 * alignment — not whether the gene is under selection, and not a statistical power calculation.
 * Callers should present it as a coarse level, not as a precise percentage.
 *
 * The model is an XGBoost gradient-boosted forest (500 trees, max_depth 6) and its score is
 * MONOTONE: non-decreasing in each of sequences, codons and median branch length, so adding data
 * can never move the estimate down. It is fit with native `monotone_constraints=(1,1,1)`, which
 * XGBoost enforces structurally at every split — a strictly stronger arrangement than this file
 * used to have, where the shipped model was an unconstrained depth-1 GBC standing in for a
 * constrained HistGBM the converter could not export, and its monotonicity was a coincidence of one
 * fit. Deleting the converter is what made the constraint shippable.
 *
 * BUT THE CONSTRAINT IS NOT IN THE ARTIFACT. `Booster.save_model()` does not persist
 * monotone_constraints — `grep monotone meme_gate.json` is empty — so nothing downstream of the
 * training run can read it, and the sidecar's `hyperparams.monotone_constraints` is free text. The
 * property is therefore MEASURED on the shipped file, not inherited from the training config:
 * verify_parity.py's SHAPE section sweeps every distinct split threshold on each axis (plus one
 * float32 step either side) against a spread of holdouts and requires the score never to fall —
 * 14,160 adjacent-pair comparisons — and fails the gate if it does. So a retrain that lost the
 * constraint would be caught by the same run that checks everything else about the artifact, rather
 * than by a reader trusting this paragraph.
 *
 * The previous model was non-monotone and trained on a proxy label (max LRT >= 5) over a population
 * unlike production — it badged alignments 'unlikely' that reported a site 72% of the time.
 *
 * Feature extraction is an EXACT port of lib/gate_features.py (pure string parsing, no deps).
 * The score is a raw predicted probability, NOT a post-hoc calibrated one; what is calibrated is
 * the choice of band thresholds — see LIKELY_MIN / UNLIKELY_MAX for the observed rates and the
 * population they were measured on.
 *
 * Feature order is FROZEN: [num_seqs, num_sites, median_pos_dist]. All three carry signal — see
 * BRANCH_SPLIT_COUNTS below.
 *
 * THERE IS NO ML RUNTIME IN THIS APP. Scoring walks XGBoost's own `save_model()` JSON directly in
 * ~40 lines (xgbEnsemble.js over meme_gate.json). There is no converter and no intermediate
 * representation: the bytes the ML team exports are the bytes the browser parses. Verified against
 * xgboost's own scoring of the same file to max |Δ| 4.4e-07 with zero band disagreements; the gate
 * that proves it is scripts/prescreen/verify_parity.py, which can be made to fail on demand
 * (--self-test) so a green run means something.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   import { loadHitLikelihoodModel } from './hitLikelihood.js';
 *   import { runHitLikelihood } from './hitLikelihoodModel.js';
 *   const model = await loadHitLikelihoodModel();
 *   const res = await runHitLikelihood(alignmentString, newickString, model);
 *   // -> { status, level, hit_probability, recommend_run, num_seqs, num_sites,
 *   //      median_pos_dist, domain }

 *
 * Calibrated OUT OF SAMPLE on the 5,982 production MEME jobs this model never trained on, against
 * an 84.79% base rate. Label = MEME reported at least one site at p <= 0.1. Clopper-Pearson 95% CIs:
 *
 *   unlikely   < 0.10    fires on  1.86% of submissions    5.4% report a site  [2.0%, 11.4%]
 *   uncertain  0.10-0.70 fires on 15.16% of submissions   51.9% report a site  [48.6%, 55.2%]
 *   likely    >= 0.70    fires on 82.98% of submissions   92.6% report a site  [91.8%, 93.3%]
 *
 * WHY THE LOW CUT IS 0.10 AND NOT 0.30. It is a real knee, not a preference. The hit rate is flat
 * at ~5% from 0.04 through 0.10 (7.1 / 4.9 / 5.4 / 5.4%) and then breaks: 11.2% at 0.12, 14.5% at
 * 0.15, 19.3% at 0.20, 28.6% at 0.30. Cut 0.10 dominates 0.05 — it fires on 44% more jobs at an
 * identical rate — and going past it is a bad trade: 0.10 -> 0.15 buys 43% more coverage for 2.7x
 * the error rate. The ML package proposed 0.30; at 28.6% [23.7, 34.0] a band labelled "unlikely"
 * would be wrong for more than one user in four. That is not a weak claim, it is an untrue one, and
 * it is the exact failure this model was retrained to fix (the previous gate badged alignments
 * 'unlikely' that hit 72% of the time). 0.10 is defensible on the observed rate; 0.30 is not.
 *
 * The band is also qualitatively coherent, which matters because copy describes it: the <0.10 jobs
 * have a median of 4 sequences (max 13) and ~140 codons at a median branch length of 0.002. Nothing
 * large or deep ever lands here, so the estimate cannot warn anyone off a well-powered dataset.
 *
 * WHY THE HIGH CUT STAYS 0.70 — and the reason is what it does to the MIDDLE band, not the top one.
 * At 0.70 the middle band is 51.9% [48.6, 55.2], a CI that straddles 50%, so "about half" is
 * literally true and the band means exactly one thing. Push it to 0.80 and the middle drifts to
 * 58%, to 0.90 and 67% — sliding toward the 84.8% base rate, at which point the middle band stops
 * carrying information and the copy goes mushy.
 *
 * WHAT 'unlikely' MAY NOT BE READ AS. 5.4% is small but it is not zero, n is only 111, and the
 * honest upper bound is 11.4%. Downstream copy must state a historical frequency over similar
 * alignments, never a probability about THIS alignment, and must never imply "will find nothing" or
 * say anything about whether the gene is under selection — the label is what MEME REPORTS. See
 * recommendation.js and noteForLevel() in hitLikelihood.js.
 *
 * verify_parity.py greps this file for both literals, so they cannot be changed here alone.

/**
 * WHAT THIS GUARD IS FOR, and what it deliberately no longer does.
 *
 * The previous model was non-monotone, so outside its split support it returned a memorised leaf at
 * full apparent confidence and the guard had to fence the support itself. This model being monotone
 * BY CONSTRUCTION, its behaviour outside the support is to saturate at the nearest ceiling or floor
 * rather than to return an arbitrary leaf — and saturation is the CORRECT extrapolation here, which
 * was checked against outcomes rather than assumed: of the 3,000 production jobs, the 7.5% that
 * saturate at least one axis were predicted 0.965 and observed 0.955. That is a one-point
 * over-prediction on n=225, i.e. accurate to within the noise, not confidently wrong. Fencing the
 * split support instead would refuse 25.9% of real submissions, mostly in the population where the
 * model is most confident AND most nearly correct.
 *
 * So FEATURE_DOMAIN is now an INPUT-VALIDITY guard: it rejects vectors that cannot describe a real
 * codon alignment, and nothing else. `null` means "no bound on this side".
 *   num_seqs >= 3        three taxa is the fewest that form an unrooted tree
 *   num_sites >= 1       an alignment with no codons is a parse failure
 *   median_pos_dist <= 10  the model's own documented contract: BL_CAP in the training pipeline,
 *                        the largest median branch length it was ever shown. Above it the tree is
 *                        almost certainly not in substitutions per site. Honest caveat: the outcome
 *                        data does NOT show the model failing there (n=45 predicted 0.846, observed
 *                        0.844) — this bound is a units sanity check, not a correction.
 * The `> 0` end of median_pos_dist is enforced by the 'missing' branch in checkFeatureDomain, which
 * is about a parse failure rather than a range.

 * The training pipeline clipped median_pos_dist into [0.001, 10.0] before fitting (meme_gate.meta

 * is NOT part of the model file — meme_gate.json is a tree table and nothing else — so the app has
 * to reproduce it, or it is scoring a different pipeline than the one that was validated.
 *
 * It is currently INERT, but for a DIFFERENT REASON than it used to be, and that is the point.
 * Measured on the shipped model, the splits on median_pos_dist span [0.00102927, 0.4023226]: the
 * floor sits just BELOW the lowest split, so flooring can never change a route, and the cap sits
 * well above the highest, so capping cannot either. The interval this comment used to state
 * ([0.0010058, 0.17963]) was the previous model's and is now wrong by more than 2x at the top —
 * the range MOVED on a retrain and the inertness had to be re-derived rather than re-asserted.
 * That is exactly why the clip is written down instead of skipped: it is one retrain away from
 * being load-bearing, and the failure mode of skipping it is silent divergence from the pipeline
 * that was validated. Note how narrow the margin at the floor is — 0.001 vs 0.00102927.
 *
 * It lives at the SCORING boundary, never in extraction. extractHitLikelihoodFeatures must keep
 * returning a raw 0.0 for "no branch lengths were parsed" — flooring it to 0.001 there would make

 *                  still be a bug: this guard turns it into an explanation the user can read. For

 *   median <= 0    is parseNewickDistances' "no positive branch lengths" sentinel, not a distance.

 *                  (50, 200, 0.005) -> 0.920 — so it does not fabricate confidence, it fabricates
 *                  discouragement, and 0.433 lands in 'uncertain' where a real shallow tree of the
 *                  same shape is 'likely'. Still a parse failure either way, so it is still
 *                  refused. Do not delete this branch on the grounds that a monotone model makes 0
