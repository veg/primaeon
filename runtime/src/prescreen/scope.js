/**
 * scope.js — part of the MEME hit-likelihood prescreen.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Ported verbatim from datamonkey3/src/lib/services/prescreen/scope.js
 * (main@fac1330), together with meme_gate.json (XGBoost's own save_model output), its sidecar
 * meme_gate.meta.json, and the two fixture files, as one directory (PLAN.md §6 reuse map). It is
 * the "MEME hit-likelihood prescreen" row of the "Before you run" panel (PLAN.md §4.3): an
 * ADVISORY band, never a gate. The original header follows.
 *
 * scope.js — which analysis methods have a MEME hit-likelihood estimate.
 *
 * A leaf module on purpose: it imports nothing, so a caller can ask "is there an estimate for this
 * method?" without pulling in the row component, the walker, or the 735 KB model file the walker
 * reads. That is the whole point of the guard — RunOutlook asks before deciding whether to load any
 * of it, and the ~14 methods that have no estimate must not pay for one. (It used to say
 * "coefficients or routing table"; there is neither any more. There is one model file, shipped
 * exactly as XGBoost wrote it, and no method routing at all.)
 *
 * Scope is MEME only because the model's training label is "MEME reported at least one selected
 * site". It is not calibrated for any other method, and re-using it for one would be a fabrication.

/**
 * Does this newick carry at least one positive branch length?
 *
 * Lives here for the same reason: the caller that chooses WHICH tree to hand the estimator has to
 * ask this before the estimator exists. It is also a precondition, not a nicety — median_pos_dist
 * is meaningless on a topology-only tree, and the model scores its 0.0 sentinel anyway: at 50 seqs
 * x 200 codons, 0.0 comes back 0.433 against 0.920 for a real (shallow) 0.005, which is a different
 * band. So the sentinel scores LOWER than a real tree, where the previous model scored it higher.
 * Either way the number is manufactured out of a parse failure, so it must be refused — this guard
 * is not made redundant by the model being monotone.
