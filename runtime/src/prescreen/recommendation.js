/**
 * recommendation.js — part of the MEME hit-likelihood prescreen.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Ported verbatim from datamonkey3/src/lib/services/prescreen/recommendation.js
 * (main@fac1330), together with meme_gate.json (XGBoost's own save_model output), its sidecar
 * meme_gate.meta.json, and the two fixture files, as one directory (PLAN.md §6 reuse map). It is
 * the "MEME hit-likelihood prescreen" row of the "Before you run" panel (PLAN.md §4.3): an
 * ADVISORY band, never a gate. The original header follows.
 *
 * recommendation.js — turns a MEME hit-likelihood level into something the user can DO.
 *
 * SCOPE: MEME, and nothing else. The model behind this was trained on one label — whether a MEME
 * run reported at least one selected site — so its output supports statements about MEME and no
 * other method. An earlier version routed users to BUSTED, aBSREL and FUBAR with lines like "it can
 * detect selection here" and "holds up better than MEME". Those are predictions about methods this
 * model has never seen scored, dressed in the authority of a number that only describes MEME. The
 * reasoning behind them was defensible textbook phylogenetics, but that is exactly the problem: it
 * was the author's judgement presented as the model's finding, and a reader has no way to tell the
 * two apart.
 *
 * So the guidance here stays inside what the estimate can actually speak to: whether MEME has
 * enough substitutions to fit its site-level tests, and what about the DATA would change that.
 * "Collect more divergent sequences" is a claim about this alignment relative to MEME's needs.
 * "Run BUSTED instead" is a claim about BUSTED. Only the first is ours to make.
 *
 * The substitution budget below is arithmetic from the same three features the model already reads,
 * not a second model: MEME fits a two-class mixture over branches at each site, so one of its tests
 * sees roughly (2*num_seqs - 3) * median_branch_length expected substitutions, and the alignment as
 * a whole sees num_sites times that.

/**
 * Thresholds in expected substitutions. Approximate by construction — they separate regimes that
 * differ by orders of magnitude, so nothing here is sensitive to the exact cut.
 *
 * Re-measured against 3,000 real MEME jobs under the CURRENT model and the current 0.10 cut: EVERY
 * alignment the model calls 'unlikely' has under 5 expected substitutions in the whole file (95th
 * percentile 3.5, median 1.7), so tooThin is the branch that fires, 65 times out of 65. This had to
 * be re-derived rather than carried over — the previous model at the previous 0.30 cut put 69 jobs
 * in the band, and a routing justification measured on a different band selecting a different
 * population would have been fiction dressed as a measurement.
 *
 * The other two branches are not dead code — they exist for the short-but-deep shape, e.g. 110
 * sequences x 8 codons at a median of 10 subs/site, which carries thousands of substitutions and
 * still scores 'unlikely' because 8 codons is too few to report on — but nothing in production hit
 * them. Left at these values deliberately: no cut inside the 'unlikely' band separates that
 * population, so moving them would be fitting to nothing.

/**
 * Copy is fixed text on purpose: each line is a claim someone can check, and all of it is about
 * MEME.
 *
 * Every rate below is an observed historical frequency over the 5,982 production MEME jobs the
 * model never trained on — 5.4% / 51.9% / 92.6% against an 84.8% base rate — phrased as a statement
 * about alignments that scored similarly, never as a probability about the user's alignment.
 *
 * The band names are doing less work than they look like they are, in BOTH directions, and the copy
 * has to absorb that:
 *   - 'unlikely' is 1 in 20, not 0. The upper end of its 95% CI is 1 in 9. So the line says
 *     "rarely", gives the frequency, and points at what would change it. It must never say "will
 *     find nothing" or "not worth running" — these are cheap runs and the honest advice is caution,
 *     not a stop.
 *   - 'likely' is 92.6% against a base rate of 84.8%, i.e. about 8 points of lift. It is the quiet
 *     default on 83% of jobs, so the line must read as "typical", never as a discovery.
