/**
 * treeSanitation.js — inspect a newick for branch lengths no downstream consumer should be handed.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Ported verbatim from datamonkey3/src/lib/utils/treeSanitation.js
 * (main@fac1330). PLAN.md §2 hard truth 4: HyphAeon is sensitive to branch-length units and
 * silently rescales, so the checks run before the model on every surface, and this is the
 * branch-length half of them. The original header follows; its measurements are on the AxoMEME
 * 2.0 inference path, whose distance formula HyphAeon's `compute_fast_dist_matrix` shares.
 *
 * treeSanitation.js — inspect a newick for branch lengths no downstream consumer should be handed.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. DM3's own tree inference emits negative branch lengths, and at least one
 * consumer crashes on them rather than degrading.
 *
 *   - src/data/shared/NJ.bf:214-220 computes the three-taxon closed form
 *     (d01 + d02 - d12) / 2 with no Max(0, ...), so any triplet violating the triangle inequality
 *     yields a negative. For four or more taxa the NJ core is C++ inside hyphy.wasm and likewise
 *     does not clamp.
 *   - src/data/shared/NJ.bf:99 returns a SATURATION SENTINEL of 1000 for a saturated pair, which
 *     propagates through that same subtraction to roughly -499.9.
 *
 * Measured consequence, on the AxoMEME 2.0 inference path:
 *   predict_regression_nexus.py:955 computes  log((node_count + 1.0) / (dist + 0.1)).
 *   Any patristic distance <= -0.1 is log of a negative -> uncaught ValueError. Verified: -0.010
 *   survives, -0.11 / -0.5 / -499.9 all crash. The handoff README's "clamps distances >= 0" refers
 *   to the TRAINING pipeline; the inference path does not clamp.
 *
 * So this is a DM3-side fact about DM3-side output, and it holds wherever a consumer runs — browser
 * or server. It is deliberately a leaf module (imports nothing) so a caller can ask before loading
 * anything heavy, matching the pattern in services/prescreen/scope.js.
 *
 * This module REPORTS. It does not silently rewrite a user's tree: clamping changes branch lengths,
 * branch lengths are the input a model's distances are built from, and quietly altering them would
 * be a fabrication of the same kind this codebase already refuses elsewhere. The caller decides
 * whether to refuse the run or to clamp with the user told.
